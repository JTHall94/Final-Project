# Final Project Ideas

As of right now, this repository contains general outlines for final project ideas. These outlines seek to answer the following questions:

1. What is a general description of the project?

2. What is the objective of the project?

3. What problem is the project trying to solve?

4. Who are the users/what are the user stories?

5. What will the file/directory hierarchy look like?

6. What will the data input/output be like?

7. What will the page design look like?


The Repository now also includes two pdf files, one which contains wireframe mockups of a couple of pages intended for the site, and the other contains an outline of possible database structure.
